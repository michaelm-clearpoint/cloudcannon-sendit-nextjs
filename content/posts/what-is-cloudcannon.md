# What is CloudCannon?

**Last modified: March 13th, 2023**

**CloudCannon is a Git-based content management system (CMS) for Jamstack-powered websites. CloudCannon empowers everyone in your team — developers have full control over their code, while editors benefit from intuitive and powerful content management workflows.**

#### **Backed by Git**

**Enjoy the security and ease of Git principles such as branching, versioning, and continuous development. Do your work locally, then push to your Git provider and automatically sync to your production site.**

#### **Easy visual editing**

**Take full control of the look of your site by developing completely in line with design specifications, with intuitive on-the-page editing, Git publishing, and reusable components — all without your editors needing to understand Git, SSGs, HTML, Markdown, or any other technical concepts. Your site has never looked this good, while being so easy for everyone to edit.**

#### **Build with components**

**Allow your team to use repeated content, data, collections or even create their own pages from components (**[**Array Structures**](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/array-structures-reference/)**). Give your team the staging environment of Git, all while keeping them on brand.**

#### **Powered by Jamstack**

**Build the best websites on the net with Jamstack. Enjoy the speed, scalability, reliability, and security that comes with the most popular static site generators.**

#### **All in one platform**

**CloudCannon keeps your static site up to date as a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool. With every change, your site is synced to your Git repo, rebuilt using your choice of SSG and optionally deployed to a global Content Delivery Network (CDN).**
